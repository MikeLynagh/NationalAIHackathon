# Energy Advisor MVP - Local Development Dependencies (Full Features)
#
# This file includes ALL dependencies for full local development,
# including Wyze smart plug support that conflicts with Streamlit Cloud.
#
# Installation:
# pip install -r requirements-local.txt

# Include all cloud-compatible dependencies
-r requirements.txt

# Additional local-only dependencies that conflict with Streamlit Cloud
wyze-sdk>=1.3.0  # Wyze smart plugs (protobuf conflict with Streamlit)

# Optional local development tools
watchdog>=2.1.5  # File watching for auto-reload (optional)

# Note: wyze-sdk requires protobuf==3.10.0 via blackboxprotobuf,
# which conflicts with Streamlit's protobuf>=3.20 requirement.
# This works locally but not on Streamlit Cloud.
